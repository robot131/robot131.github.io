Auto-focusing is an essential task for lensfree holographic microscopy, where the optimal focal plane needs to be determined from refocused Z-stack data. In this work, we propose a new auto-focusing criterion, nuclear norm of gradient (NoG), to enhance the accuracy of distance estimation for lensfree imaging.
