title: "Lensless masked imaging with self-calibrated phase retrieval"
---

## Published in: 06/12/2023

Lensless imaging with mask modulation is an attractive topic since it enables a compact configuration to acquire a complex wavefield of a sample with computational approaches. Most existing methods choose a customized phase mask for wavefront modulation and then decode the sample’s wave field from captured diffraction patterns. Different from phase masks, lensless imaging with a binary amplitude mask facilitates a cheaper fabrication cost, but the problem of high-quality mask calibration and image reconstruction have not been well resolved. In this paper, we proposed a self-calibrated phase retrieval (SCPR) method, realizing a joint recovery of a binary mask and sample’s wave field for a lensless masked imaging system. Compared with conventional methods, our method shows a high-performance and flexible image recovery.
