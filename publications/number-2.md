title: "Lensfree on-chip microscopy based on single-plane phase retrieval"
---

## Published in: 05/10/2022 &emsp; on [*Optics Express*](https://opg.optica.org/oe/home.cfm)

In this paper, we proposed a single-frame phase retrieval with nonlinear optimization, termed SFPR-NL, to realize high-fidelity sample reconstruction for lensfree on-chip microscopy. In our method, lensfree image recovery is constructed as a quadratic phase retrieval problem to reconstruct the transmitted field of the sample, where total variation and denoising priors are imposed to guarantee an efficient convergence. Based on the computational framework, we establish a 3D-printed lensless imaging platform to verify the superiority of our method.

Fig.4 Reconstructed results of polystyrene beads (50Âµm). (a1) and (a2) are recorded holograms when the sample is loaded or removed. (b1) and (b2) are reconstructed amplitude images that are related to the transmitted wave field and background field. (c) is obtained by subtracting the background field from the transmitted wave field. (d) is plotted from the blue cross-line of (c).
