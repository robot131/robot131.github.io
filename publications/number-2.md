title: "Lensfree on-chip microscopy based on single-plane phase retrieval"
---

## Published in: 05/10/2022 on [*Optics Express*](https://opg.optica.org/oe/home.cfm)

In this paper, we proposed a single-plane phase retrieval to realize high-fidelity sample reconstruction for lensfree on-chip microscopy. In our method, lensfree image recovery is constructed as a quadratic phase retrieval problem to reconstruct the transmitted field of the sample, where total variation and denoising priors are imposed to guarantee an efficient convergence. Based on the computational framework, we establish a 3D-printed lensless imaging platform to verify the superiority of our method.
