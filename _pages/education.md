I have been learning in Harbin Institute of Technology for 6 years. During this period of time, I participated in various kinds of activities and competitions. These not only practiced my skills but I gained valuable friendship. In the meanwhile, as a student, I did not relax in my study. During my stage of undergraduate, I studied hard and get 90 or more point in many courses. Finally, I was recommended to pursue a master's degree with the fourth place in my major and GPA of 88.9/100. The following sections shows my education experiences and awards I gained during the process.
