## First Author

## [Single-shot lensless masked imaging with enhanced self-calibrated phase retrieval](../publications/number-6.md)

Published in *Optics Letters*, 2024

Authors：**Shenghao Zheng**, Fannuo Xu, Cheng Guo

In this paper, we proposed an enhanced self-calibrated phase retrieval (eSCPR) method, introducing the idea of wavefront decoupling into lessless masked imaging (LMI) systems and realizing single-shot LMI.

## [Lensless masked imaging with self-calibrated phase retrieval](../publications/number-3.md)

Published in *Optics Letters*, 2023

Authors：**Shenghao Zheng**, Zhihui Ding, Rui Jiang, and Cheng Guo

In this paper, we proposed a self-calibrated phase retrieval (SCPR) method to realize a joint recovery of a binary mask and sample’s wave field for a lensless masked imaging system.

## [A portable lensfree imaging platform based on prior-guided phase retrieval](../publications/number-7.md)

Under peer-review

Authors：**Shenghao Zheng**, and Cheng Guo

In this paper, we presented a portable lensfree imaging platform that can achieve complex wavefield reconstruction with multi-distance intensity measurements. In data processing, we propose a prior-guided phase retrieval algorithm (prGPR) to realize a data-efficient recovery. Constructed of blocks, our portable lensfree platform provides a low-cost DIY microscope scheme, giving more children a chance to launch hands-on science experiments.

## Second Author

## [Lensfree auto-focusing imaging with coarse-to-fine tuning method](../publications/number-5.md)

Published in *Optics and Lasers in Engineering*, 2024

Authors：Zhihui Ding, **Shenghao Zheng**, Feilong Zhang, Qiang Li, Cheng Guo

In this paper, we proposed a coarse-to-fine tuning method for fast and robust lensfree auto-focusing imaging. In our method, a pre-defined simulation-driven focus network (sFocusNet) is constructed to find the coarse estimation of diffractive distances and output the searching range. Then, a new sharpness metric, regularization of gradient (RoG), is built to get the final estimation within the searching range.

## [Dual-constrained physics-enhanced untrained neural network for lensless imaging](../publications/number-4.md)

Published in *Journal of the Optical Society of America A*, 2024

Authors：Zehua Wang, **Shenghao Zheng**, Zhihui Ding, Cheng Guo

In this paper, we proposed a dual-constrained physics-enhanced untrained neural network (DPENet) for single-frame lensless imaging, providing an effective and robust way to solve the overfitting problem of untrained networks, which will facilitate further application of untrained networks in lensless imaging.

## [Lensfree on-chip microscopy based on single-plane phase retrieval](../publications/number-2.md)

Published in *Optics Express*, 2022

Authors：Cheng Guo, Xianming Liu, Feilong Zhang, Yongbin, Du, **Shenghao Zheng**, Zehua Wang, Xiaoqing Zhang, Xingchi Kan, Zhengjun Liu and Weibo Wang

In this paper, we proposed a novel single-plane phase retrieval method, realizing high-quality sample reconstruction for lensfree on-chip microscopy.

## [Lensfree auto-focusing imaging using nuclear norm of gradient](../publications/number-1.md)

Published in *Optics and Lasers in Engineering*, 2022

Authors：Cheng Guo, Feilong Zhang, Xianming Liu, Qiang Li, **Shenghao Zheng**, Jiubin Tan,Zhengjun Liu and Weibo Wang

In this paper, we proposed a new auto-focusing criterion, nuclear norm of gradient (NoG), realizing a robust lensfree auto-focusing.
