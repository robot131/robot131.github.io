# Skills

## Experiment Skills:

+ Construct different kinds of lensless imaging systems including lensless on-chip imaging systems, lensless masked imaging systems, PIE imaging systems et al. Perform the experimental system to achieve the expected results.

## Programming Skills:

### + Matlab (Proficient):
  + Use programming language to reproduce physical processes.
  + Build up mathematical models for the imaging system (LMI, lensless on-chip imaging system, PIE et al.).
  + Establish the inverse problem and solve the problem with numerical methods.
### + Python (Proficient):
  + Construct various kinds of neural network models using Pytorch package.
  + Processing images with Opencv package. Perform supervised and self-supervised training.
  + Call the pre-trained networks in matlab.
  + Combine the advantages of the two programming languages (Python, Matlab) to solve the image inverse problems.
### + SolidWorks (Proficient):
  + Design 3-D printed adapters and connectors.
  + Opto-mechanical system design and process.
