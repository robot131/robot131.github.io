My research interests include: 
+ Computational imaging
+ Miniaturized device design
+ Computer Vision
+ Deep learning methods and their applications in solving inverse imaging problems.

For more detailed information about my academic and research experiences, you can also refer to the [Research](../_pages/research.md), and  [Publications](../_pages/publications.md) of this website.

# Skills

## Experiment Skills:

Construct different kinds of lensless imaging systems including lensless on-chip imaging systems, lensless masked imaging (LMI) systems, ptychographic iterative engine (PIE) imaging systems et al. Perform the experimental system to achieve the expected results.

## Programming Skills:

### Matlab (Proficient):
+ Use programming language to reproduce physical processes.
+ Build up mathematical models for the imaging system (LMI system, PIE system et al.).
+ Establish the inverse problems and solve them mathematically.

### Python (Proficient):
+ Construct various kinds of neural network models using Pytorch package.
+ Processing images with Opencv package. Perform supervised and self-supervised training.
+ Call the pre-trained networks in matlab.
+ Combine the advantages of the two programming languages (Python, Matlab) to solve the image inverse problems.

### SolidWorks (Proficient):
+ Design 3-D printed adapters and connectors.
+ Opto-mechanical system design and process.

# Hobbies

I love doing sports. In my opinion, engaging in sports and physical activities improves overall fitness and stamina. Also, the endorphins released during the process, which are natural mood lifters, leads to reduced stress and anxiety levels. Therefore, I exercise regularly and consider it an integral part of my life. My favorite sports including:

+ [Badminton](../vlogs/badminton.md): No less than once a week. A sport that can exercise the whole body and make friends with people of the same hobby.

+ [Snowboarding](../news/snowboarding.md): No less than once a week in winnter. A sport that improve the balance and coordination of the body. Currently I have just passed the examination of Chinese national Social sports instructor (snowboarding) and became a primary snowboarding instructor. It's really very cool when snowboarding and I really love it.

+ Swimming: No less than once a week in summer. A sport that can exercise the whole body and relieve the heat quickly in summer.

I also love travelling. As an old saying goes, read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles. These years I have travelled to many places with my friends or families, including: [changbai mountains](../vlogs/changbai.md), [The Great Wall](../vlogs/changcheng.md), [The West Lake](../vlogs/xihu.md), [the Northernmost Point of China](../news/north_point.md)(53°33’42’‘N 123°15’30’‘E) et al.
