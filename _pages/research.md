Lensless imaging method based on mask modulation June 2022 – June 2024 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and set up the lensless masked imaging (LMI) system for data collection.
    \item Proposed a self-calibrated phase retrieval (SCPR) method that can jointly retrieve the binary amplitude mask and the complex wave field of a sample.
    \item Introduced the idea of wavefront decoupling into LMI systems, which was commonly used in ptychographic iterative engine (PIE) imaging systems.
    \item Proposed an enhanced self-calibrated phase retrieval (eSCPR) method that can realize single-shot, dynamic LMI.
    
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Dual-constrained physics-enhanced untrained neural network for lensless imaging} \hfill June 2022 - October 2023 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constructed the basic workflow of the self-supervised untrained DPENet with Mr. Zehua Wang.
    \item Set up the lensless imaging system and assisted in completing the data collection work.
    \item Assisted in replying to reviews' comments.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Lensfree auto-focusing imaging with coarse-to-fine tuning method} \hfill June 2022 – June 2024 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constructed the basic backbone of the sFocusNet with Mr. Zhihui Ding.
    \item Set up the experimental system and assisted in completing the data collection work.
    \item Assisted in replying to reviews' comments.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Lensfree brick-assembled microscopy based on prior-guided phase retrieval (on preparing)} \hfill March 2024–Present 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed a brick-assembled lensfree microscopy, providing a toy-based microscopic platform for preschool education.
    \item Proposed a prior-guided phase retrieval algorithm that can reconstruct the complex wavefield of samples with high quality and low running time.
\end{itemize}
