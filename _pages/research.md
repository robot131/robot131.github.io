## Lensless imaging method based on mask modulation
*June 2022 – June 2024*
+ Designed and set up the lensless masked imaging (LMI) system for data collection.
+ Proposed a self-calibrated phase retrieval [(SCPR)](../publications/number-3.md) method that can jointly retrieve the binary amplitude mask and the complex wave field of a sample.
+ Introduced the idea of wavefront decoupling into LMI systems, which was commonly used in ptychographic iterative engine (PIE) imaging systems.
+ Proposed an enhanced self-calibrated phase retrieval [(eSCPR)](../publications/number-6.md) method that can realize single-shot, dynamic LMI.

## [The 16th National Smart Car Competition](../news/smart_car.md)
*January 2021 – June 2021*

    
## Dual-constrained physics-enhanced untrained neural network for lensless imaging
*June 2022 - October 2023*
+ Constructed the basic workflow of the self-supervised untrained [DPENet](../publications/number-4.md) with Mr. Zehua Wang.
+ Set up the lensless imaging system and assisted in completing the data collection work.
+ Assisted in replying to reviews' comments.

## Lensfree auto-focusing imaging with coarse-to-fine tuning method
*June 2022 – June 2024*
+ Constructed the basic backbone of the sFocusNet with Mr. Zhihui Ding.
+ Set up the experimental system and assisted in completing the data collection work.
+ Assisted in replying to reviews' comments.

## Lensfree brick-assembled microscopy based on prior-guided phase retrieval (on preparing)
*March 2024–Present*
+ Designed a brick-assembled lensfree microscopy, providing a toy-based microscopic platform for preschool education.
+ Proposed a prior-guided phase retrieval algorithm that can reconstruct the complex wavefield of samples with high quality and low running time.
