intro: In this paper, we proposed a coarse-to-fine tuning method for fast and robust lensfree auto-focusing imaging. In our method, a pre-defined simulation-driven focus network (sFocusNet) is constructed to find the coarse estimation of diffractive distances and output the searching range. Then, a new sharpness metric, regularization of gradient (RoG), is built to get the final estimation within the searching range.
