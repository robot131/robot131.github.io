intro: In this paper, we proposed a dual-constrained physicsenhanced untrained neural network (DPENet) for single-frame lensless imaging, providing an effective and robust way to solve the overfitting problem of untrained networks, which will facilitate further application of untrained networks in lensless imaging.
