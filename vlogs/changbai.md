title: Reach the Main Peak of the Changbaishan Heaven Lake
---

## *Date*: 06/04/2024

Changbaishan, getting its name because of covering with snow all year round, is one of the ﬁrst three biosphere reserves in the People’s Republic of China. And the Heaven Lake, situated on a crater, crowns the highest peak of the Chinese Changbai volcanic range. Due to the special climate, the Heaven Lake is sometimes obscured by fog. Fortunately, the weather was fine on the day we went, so we could get a clear view of Heaven Lake. The first photo is a view of Heaven Lake, with North Korea visible across the lake. The second is a group photo of my friend and me, where I’m on the left.
