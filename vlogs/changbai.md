title: Reach the Main Peak of the Changbaishan Heaven Lake
---

## *Date*: 06/04/2024

Changbaishan, getting its name because of covering with snow all year round, is one of the ﬁrst three biosphere reserves in the People’s Republic of China. And the Heaven Lake, situated on a crater, crowns the highest peak of the Chinese Changbai volcanic range. Due to the special climate, the Heaven Lake is sometimes obscured by fog. Fortunately, the weather was fine on the day we went, so we could see the overview of the Heaven Lake. The first photo was the overview of the Heaven Lake, and we could see North Korea across the lake. The second was a group photo of me and my friend, and I was on the left.
