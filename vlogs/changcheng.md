The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. And Badaling, the best preserved section of the Great Wall, locates at Beijing and has a beautiful surrounding scenery and its structures show a special grandeur. The photos above were taken during our journey on Badaling Great Wall. The first photo was a view of Badaling Great Wall. The second was a group photo of me and my friend, and I was on the left.
