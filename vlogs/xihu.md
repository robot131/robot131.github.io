West Lake is an iconic, symbolic sight in Hangzhou and is regarded as one of the most beautiful sights in China. Its beauty is the subject of many poems and paintings. In the summer of 2023, me and my family went to Hangzhou and the photo above was taken by the West Lake. The scenery was so beautiful that we didn't want to leave even under such a hot weather.
