title: The 16th National Smart Car Competition
---

## *Date*: 06/22/2021

The time I spent with my teammates preparing for the smart car competition is one of the most unforgettable experience during my stage of undergraduate. The experience not only equipped me with practical knowledge and skills, but also led us to find each other who had a common goal. After the competation, except a member who didn't do anything, the rest four of us become very good friends. Here, I will review the entire process of the competition and describe in detail the part I was responsible for. The rest parts are arranged as follows: first, I will introduce the task we are expected to complete in the competation, and figure out which part I was in charge of, second, I will break down my responsibilities into smaller steps, and describe the goal of each step and the methods that I utilized, then, a video of the whole-loop test is performed to show the achievement
of our group, finally, photos of our group and the certificate of the competation are shown.
