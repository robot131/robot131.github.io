title: The 16th National Smart Car Competition
---

## *Date*: 06/22/2021

The time I spent with my teammates on preparing the smart car competition is one of the most unforgettable experience during my stage of undergraduate. The experience not only equipped me with practical knowledge and skills, but also led us to find each other who had a common goal. After the competation, except a member who didn't do anything, the rest four of us become very good friends. You can also find a photo of us taken in our Undergraduate Graduation Ceremony in the first photo of [this page](../news/BA_gra.md).

In this page, I will review the entire process of the competition and describe in detail the part I was responsible for. The rest parts are arranged as follows: first, I will introduce the task we are expected to complete in the competation, and figure out which part I was in charge of, second, I will break down my responsibilities into smaller steps, and describe the goal of each step and the methods that I utilized, then, a video of the whole-loop test is performed to show the achievement of our group, finally, photos of our group and the certificate of the competation are shown.

[Task Description](#jump1) / [Division of labor](#jump2)


## Task Description <span id="jump1"></span>

Our competition topic is aerospace intelligent logistics, and the task is transporting specially designed goods on a pre-built track. Fig.1 shows the schematic of the race track, and the smart car that we utilized is shown in the top left corner. As marked in Fig.1, the race track consists several parts of areas. In the preparation period, the smart car is place in the debug area, and two participants of the team are allowed to bring one laptop each to test and control the smart car remotely. Other three participants are set in the embarkation area, the delivery area and next to traffic light, respectively. The process of a whole circle can be summarized as: 
+ Place the smart car into the waiting area and wait for the start signal
+ The game begin. The car first go to the embarkation area and stop. The participant there load a cargo model on the car.
+ Move forward and stop in front of the stop line.
+ If the color of the traffic light is green or yellow, the car could simply go through this area. If the color is red, the car should wait until the traffic light turns green or yellow.
+ Pass the tunnel and speed bump and arrives the delivery area.
+ Stop for a while.The participant there unload the cargo model.
+ Keep going and get across the roadblocks to arrive at the start of the S road.
+ Pass the S road without touching the boundary lines (the redline and the blue line in Fig.1).
+ Move to the waiting area and a whole circle complete.

It should be emphasized that the test and debug operation are only allowed in the preparation period. When the game start, no extra operation is allowed expect restarting. Thus, the smart car should move automatically during the entire match. The competition is based on a points system, and the actions that you can *get points* including: 
+ Move to the delivery area automatically (2 points),
+ Stop in the delivery area (2 points),
+ Pass the traffic light correctly (3 points),
+ Move to the delivery area (3 points),
+ Pass the roadblocks (2 points),
+ Pass the S road correctly (5 points),
+ Move to the waiting area (1 points).

The deduction items including: 
+ Pass the traffic light incorrectly or press the stop line when stopping (-3 points),
+ Press the boundary lines when passing the S road (-1 points).

The game last for a period of time, and you should accomplish as much circles as you can to gain more points. To meet all the requirements and accomplish the race, the car is equipped with a monocular camera on the head and a laser SLAM on the back, as shown in the top left corner of Fig. 1. We use the laser SLAM to construct the model of the race track before the game start and to measure the surrouding distance during the game to avoid the car crashing to the edge of the track. The pictures the camera takes are used to correct the movement locus during the S road and to decide whether the car should stop in front of the traffic light. An NVIDIAÂ® Jetson Nano is used as the main control board to recieve messages from the laser SLAM and the camera and output conmmands to the motors. 

## Division of labor <span id="jump2"></span>

According to the competation goals and the basic constitution of the smart car, the whole task is divided into five parts corresponding to five members:
1. Debug and maintain the electrical and mechanical structure of the smart car
2. Light up the camera and process the pictures recorded during moving, and give proper messages to the main control board
3. Use the laser SLAM to construct the model of the race track before the game start, and to measure the surrouding distance during the game. Then send the distance information to the main control board
4. Recieve the messages from the camera and the laser SLAM, and use the messages to give motion orders to the motor to move the car correctly
5. Make a visual Interface on the laptop that can interact with the car, give orders to the car, and check the status of the car during the game

The part that I was responsible for is the second item. Since the member who was responsible for the forth part hung up his boots, our group leader who was in charge of the laser SLAM and I took over this work and solved the parts that were relevant to each of us.

## The Computer Vision Part

## Whole loop test

Since no photos or video are allowed during the game, here we exhibit a video recorded during our preparation for the competation. We can see that all the functions works correctly and the car accomplised a whole circle without any error.

## Our group and the certificate

After a semester of hard work, we finnaly won the first prize of the northern division. The following photos are the teams of our school and the certificate of mine. Our team is on the left of the first photo.
