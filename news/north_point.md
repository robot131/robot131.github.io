title: Reach the Northernmost Point of China
---

## *Date*: 05/31/2024

It was very exiting that after driving **3 days** and covering a distance around **1500km**, we finally arrived the Northernmost Point of China (53°33'42''N 123°15'30''E). The first photo was the boundary marker, and we could see Russia just across the river. The second was a group photo of me and my friend, and I was on the left.
