title: Reach the Northernmost Point of China
---

### *Date*: 05/31/2024

It was very exciting that after driving **3 days** and covering a distance of around **1500km**, we finally arrived at the Northernmost Point of China (53°33'42''N 123°15'30''E). The first photo is the boundary marker, where we could see Russia just across the river. The second is a group photo of my friend and I, and I was on the left.
